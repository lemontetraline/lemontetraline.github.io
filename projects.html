                <h2>P1: bee game ripoff</h2>
                <p>an old game of mine that was never finished (you'll hear this quite a lot here)</p>
                <p>whole game was made by me, including images, uses profilestore and OOP 🤯🤯 for bees</p>

                <h2>P2: sushi game</h2>
                <p>the game we made with my friend baj</p>
                <p>it was almost finished, most of the  game is done, it works pretty well</p>
                <p>the game is loop is that you cook sushi, the customer arrive to your place, but since your cooking is atrocious, they eventually die after consuming a couple of your sushis</p>
                <p>it is multiplayer, so everyone on the server works on the restaurant</p>
                <p>your goal is to upgrade your restaurant, and if your cash goes below 0 by the end of the day, you've officialy lost the game, so the server closes and everyone gets teleoprted to a fresh one</p>
